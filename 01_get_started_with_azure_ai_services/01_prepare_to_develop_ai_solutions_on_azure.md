# 1. Prepare to develop AI solutions on Azure


## Understand capabilities of Azure Machine Learning
Microsoft Azure provides the Azure Machine Learning service - a cloud-based platform for running experiments at scale to train predictive models from data, and publish the trained models as services. Azure ML provides the following features and capabilities:

| Feature | Capability |
| --- | --- |
| Automated ML | This feature enables non-experts to quickly create an effective machine learning model from data. |
| Azure ML Designer | A graphical interface enabling no-code development of machine learning solutions. |
| Data and compute management | Cloud-based data storage and compute resources that professional data scientists can use to run data experiment code at scale. |
| Pipelines | Data scientists, software engineers, and IT operations professionals can define pipelines to orchestrate model training, deployment, and management tasks. |


## Understand capabilities of Azure AI Services

Azure AI Services are cloud-based that you can use as building blocks to compose sophisticated, intelligent applications.

## Understand capabilities of the Azure OpenAI Service

Azure OpenAI Service is an Azure AI service for deploying, utilizing, and fine-tuning models developed by OpenAI. Both REST and language specific SDKs are available when developing applications.

## Understand capabilities of Azure AI Search

Azure AI Search is an Applied AI Service for ingesting and indexing data from various sources, and search the index to find, filter, and sort information extracted from the source data.

Azure AI Search enables you to define an enrichment pipeline that uses AI skills to enhance the index with insights derived from the source data, for example:
- by using computer vision and natural language processing capabilities to generate descriptions of images
- extract text from scanned documents
- determine key phrases in large documents that encapsulate their key points.

The insights extracted by your enrichment pipeline can be persisted in a knowledge store for further analysis or integration into a data pipeline for a business intelligence solution.
